## Quick Start

**1. Create a new site** cloning the repo and removing the origin repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:statamic/starter-kit-doogie-browser.git diary
cd diary
rm -rf .git
composer install
cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate
```

**2. Make a new user** – you'll want it to be a `super` so you have access to everything.

```
php please make:user
```

**3. Recompile the CSS** (optional)

The [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) included in this kit is compiled with [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) to reduce filesize on any unused classes and selectors. If you want to modify anything, just recompile it.

```
npm i && npm run dev
```

To compile for production again:
```
npm run production
```

**4. Do your thing!**

If you're using [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet) (or similar), your site should be available at `http://diary.test`. You can access the control panel at `http://diary.test/cp` and login with your new user. Open up the source code, follow along with the [Statamic 3 docs](https://statamic.dev), and enjoy!
